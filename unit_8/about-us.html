				<p>Vandelay Industries is a family owned business. Our goal has always been to facilitate our finest products to clients around the world. Quality is essential to Vandelay and we aim to provide service that you will not be able to find elsewhere.
				</p>

				<p>The history of Vandelay begins in Manhattan. Arthur Vandelay came to the United States as an immigrant. He worked in manufacturing of all varities: steel, plastics, apparel, until he finally transitioned over to synthetics. A small factory was purchased in lower Manhattan and set into motion an empire of latex.
				</p>

				<p>Arthur's two young sons developed an interest in the company after attending college at CUNY. They both attained degrees in engineering and have been responsible for many of the cutting edge latex products provided to our customers. Although Arthur's two sons have been an integral part of the business, his daugther manages the day to day operations, including overseas communications.
